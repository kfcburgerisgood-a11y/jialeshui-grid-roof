"""The grid roof: an 18 x 12 m eroded roof on a 6 m beam grid, built in pieces.

An application of compas_vol. On a Grasshopper canvas its parts would be:

* :class:`Brief` -- the sliders: every number, saved as JSON.
* :class:`Drawing` -- the referenced curves and points.
* :mod:`grid_roof.design` -- the components, one function per step;
  :func:`design_roof` runs them all, like a cluster.
* :mod:`grid_roof.checks`, :mod:`grid_roof.preview` -- panels and the viewport.
* :mod:`grid_roof.printing` -- a piece as a sample for a desktop printer.
* :mod:`grid_roof.nodes` -- the Grasshopper components, as plain functions.

:class:`Drainage`, :class:`Incision`, :class:`VolHeightField`,
:class:`Spinodoid` and :func:`grid_kit` are specific to this roof and live
here.
