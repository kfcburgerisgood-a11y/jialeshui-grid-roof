# grid-roof

An 18 × 12 m roof, 600 mm thick, on a 6 m beam grid, designed as one distance field
and built as 53 pieces: rain channels on the deck, a porous soffit, light openings
and planters. An application of [compas_vol](https://github.com/rccn-dev/compas_vol),
and the template for the designs in the
[workshop](https://github.com/rccn-dev/designing-by-process).

## Install

Clone it next to compas_vol, which it builds against:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rccn-dev/compas_vol
git clone https://github.com/rccn-dev/grid-roof
cd grid-roof
uv sync --extra notebook
```

Step by step, with checks: [install](docs/install.md).

## Quick start

```bash
uv run jupyter lab walkthrough.ipynb       # the design, step by step
uv run python print_sample.py panel_0_1_00 # one piece, ready for PrusaSlicer
uv run python build.py --out out           # every piece, with a manifest of checks
```
